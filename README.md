Find an issue somewhere in one of the OpenMined GitHub repositories and submit a pull request with your solution! The more useful the PR, the better. A great starting point would be the issues labeled beginner under pysft [here](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/labels/beginner) but you are free to find others in other repositories. Submit your Github link in the comment section of the video. Good luck!
